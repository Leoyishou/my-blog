what is wiki
***
A wiki is a collaborative online platform that allows users to create, edit, and maintain interlinked web pages. It serves as a knowledge base where information can be collected, organized, and shared among people. The most famous example of a wiki is Wikipedia, a free, user-generated encyclopedia that contains articles on a wide range of topics.

The term "wiki" originates from the Hawaiian word "wiki-wiki," which means "quick" or "fast." This is because wikis are designed to enable rapid and easy content creation, editing, and organization by multiple users.

Wikis often have a simple markup language or a rich-text editor, which allows users to format text, add links, and insert multimedia elements without having to learn complex programming languages. Access to wikis can be open to the public or restricted to specific user groups, depending on the purpose and intended audience.

GitHub is a web-based platform primarily used for version control and collaboration in software development. While it's not a wiki platform in the traditional sense, it does offer a feature called GitHub Wiki, which allows you to create and maintain documentation or other project-related information alongside your code repository.

To create and use a wiki on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Wiki" tab near the top of the page, next to "Issues" and "Pull requests."
3. If no wiki has been created yet, click on the "Create the first page" button.
4. Enter a title for your wiki page and add the content using the Markdown editor.
5. Click the "Save page" button to save your changes.

Once you've created the initial wiki page, you can add more pages, edit existing pages, and manage the wiki as needed. GitHub Wiki supports Markdown syntax, which allows you to format text, create tables, add links, and insert images or other multimedia elements.

Keep in mind that by default, the GitHub Wiki is publicly accessible, and anyone with a GitHub account can edit it. However, you can change the settings to restrict editing to collaborators only by navigating to your repository settings and selecting the "Restrict editing to collaborators only" checkbox under the "Wikis" section.
