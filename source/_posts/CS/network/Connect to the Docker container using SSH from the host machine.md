## Key points

在容器中下载好ssh
- I dont't used to write locally  我过去并不是本地写，用虚拟机的sdk跑，

  而是本地写，本地sdk检查，然后把检查后的代码传到虚拟机文件夹里，用虚拟机的sdk跑

  本质上来说不是sdk的远距离起作用，只是利用了一个文件同步功能，然后本地检查和远地运行分开

-   dockerfile？ 

-   docker build？

## From ChatGPT

1. Create a Dockerfile:

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in a directory. This file will contain instructions to build a Docker image with SSH enabled.

```dockerfile
# Use an existing image as the base
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install OpenSSH server
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server

# Create the /var/run/sshd directory (for privilege separation)
RUN mkdir -p /var/run/sshd

# Set the root password for SSH access
RUN echo 'root:YOUR_PASSWORD' | chpasswd

# Expose the SSH port
EXPOSE 22

# Start the SSH server
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
```

Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with a secure password of your choice.

2. Build the Docker image:

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

```sh
docker build -t my_ssh_container .
```

This will create a new Docker image named `my_ssh_container` with SSH enabled.

3. Run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 2222:22 --name my_ssh_container_instance my_ssh_container
```

This command will start a new container named `my_ssh_container_instance` based on the `my_ssh_container` image. It maps the container's port 22 (SSH) to the host's port 2222.

4. Connect to the Docker container via SSH:

From the host machine or another computer, you can now connect to the Docker container using SSH:

```sh
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
```

Replace `localhost` with the IP address of the host machine if you're connecting from another computer. Enter the password you set in the Dockerfile when prompted.

You should now have SSH access to your Docker container. Note that this method is not recommended for production environments, as it has security implications. For production, consider using `docker exec` to access the container or setting up proper user authentication and key-based authentication for SSH.
