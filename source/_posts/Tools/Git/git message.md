how can i write effective git message
***
Writing effective Git commit messages is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable project history. Good commit messages help you and your collaborators quickly understand the changes made in each commit. Here are some guidelines to write effective Git commit messages:

1. Write a **concise and descriptive subject line**: The first line of the commit message should be a short summary (up to 50 characters) of the changes made. Begin with a capital letter and use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").

2. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line: If you need to provide more details about the commit, leave a blank line after the subject line and then write the body. This separation makes the message easier to read.

3. Wrap the body at 72 characters: When writing a longer commit message with a body, limit each line to 72 characters. This ensures that the message is properly formatted and easy to read in various Git tools.

4. Use the body to **explain what and why**: The body should explain what changes were made and the reasons for those changes. Focus on the context and the motivation behind the changes, rather than describing the exact lines of code that were altered.

5. Use bullet points or lists: If you need to describe multiple changes, use bullet points or lists to make the commit message more readable.

6. Use proper grammar and punctuation: Ensure your commit messages are well-written, with proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. This makes the messages easier to understand and looks more professional.

Here's an example of an effective Git commit message:

```
Add validation for user registration form

- Check if email is unique
- Ensure password meets complexity requirements
- Validate input length for all fields
```

This example has a clear and descriptive subject line, a blank line separating the subject from the body, a concise explanation of the changes made, and proper formatting.
